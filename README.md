# C Programming Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of practical C programming projects, designed to strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Overview

Each project explores different aspects of C programming, including:

- **Functions** – Modular code design and function implementation.
- **Arrays** – One-dimensional and multi-dimensional array operations.
- **Strings** – String manipulation and related standard library functions.
- **Pointers** – Pointer basics, arithmetic, and advanced usage.
- **File Handling** – Reading from and writing to files using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, etc.
- **Data Structures** – Using `struct` to define and manage complex data types.
- **Basic Algorithms** – Logic building through sorting, searching, and other algorithmic challenges.
